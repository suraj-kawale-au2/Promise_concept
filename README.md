# Javascript Promises.

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

## Problems while writing Async Javascript.

### "Callback Hell"

Asynchronous JavaScript, or JavaScript that uses callbacks, is hard to get right intuitively.It Looks like this.

```
getSomeData(function(x){
    getSomeMoreData(x, function(y){
        getSomeSomeMoreData(y, function(z){ 
            console.log(z);
        });
    });
});

```

### "What are callbacks?"

Callbacks are just the name of a convention for using JavaScript functions. There isn't a special thing called a 'callback' in the JavaScript language, it's just a convention. Instead of immediately returning some result like most functions, functions that use callbacks take some time to produce a result. The word 'asynchronous', aka 'async' just means 'takes some time' or 'happens in the future, not right now'. Usually callbacks are only used when doing I/O, e.g. downloading things, reading files, talking to databases, etc.

### "How Promises Rescues From CallBack Hell"

`Promise me it wonâ€™t ever happen again`

To Battle the problem of syntactical hell some wise men created the idea of Promise.
These are the Basic Principles Behind Promise.

```
* Promises provide control over result of a callback:to **resolve or to reject**.
* All Promises objects have **.then()** method attached to them.

```
## Lets Create Our First Promise.

```

//Promise Constructor.
var promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve,reject)){
     //Write your promise code here.
     //
     resolve(somevalue); //fulfilled
     //or
     reject("error");   //rejected
)};

promise1.then(function(value){
    console.log(value);
})

```

Promise has one of these states:

* **pending**: initial state,neither fulfilled nor rejected.
* **fulfilled**: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
* **rejected**: meaning that the operation failed.

### Lets Go through a Good analogy with code.

Imagine you are training your puppy dog to be a good dog. You are making him learn command 'sit' . So when you say sit he should sit and you give him a treat and say good dog.

Lets code this situation out in Javascript Promise World.

This way you create a Basic Promise.

```
var DidDogSat = true;

var WillGetTreat = new Promise(
    function(resolve,reject){
        if(DidDogSat){
            var treat = {
                eats : 'Pedigree',
                says : 'Good dog'
            };
        
        resolve(treat); // promise get fullfills
    } else {
        var reason = new Error('Dog bit you instead');
        reject(reason); // promise get rejected
    }
   
  }
);

```

This way you consume the Promise

```
var Dog = function() {

   WillGetTreat
    .then(function(fulfilled){
        console.log("Say",fulfilled.says,"Give him some",fulfilled.eats);
    })
    .catch(function(error){
        console.log(error.message)
    })
    
}

```

### Promise Chaining 

Since we have ***.then()*** object we could chain it using this. It will help you mimic serial control.
In Code you can do this

```
Promisecall(url)
 .then(process1)
 .then(process2)
 .then(process3)

```
These are some functions which returns a Promise

* **fetch()**
* **process()**
* **save()**

### Error Handling

Promises have both success and error handling mechanism and we see it very often.
**.catch()** object will help us catch the error. Here is example for this.

```
fetch()
  .then()
  .catch(error)

```
***Always end all promise chains with **.catch()**.***

## Assignment 

 * Select any number at random from **arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,17,19,20,21,22,23]**.

 * For the selected number get the name of user from api **https://api.github.com/users** .


 * For the selected username make apicall **https://api.github.com/users/username**  and return the sum of followers and following.

 * Write your code inside [this](function.js) file.

 * Your code should pass the basic test written in [test](function.test.js).
 
```
 Example
 
  num = 45 
 
  SumOfFollowersAndFollowing = 576
```
